Once upon a time there lived a swan. She was lost when she was a child and was raised among a flock of ducks.
She was a beautiful black swan. The white ducklings did not play with her because she was different.
As time passed by, she started growing taller than the other ducks.
The ducks realised she is a swan.
And they started worshipping her.
She lived a happy life.
